------------------------Older------------------------------
DMSS030: clean / some alpha waves / enough trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated

DMSS031: not too noisy / some blink-like artifacts still seen / enough trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, high freq noise in the second half, clean set generated

DMSS032: beha data recoverd from EEG, 23 blocks
2022-12-24-wen: doICA


DMSS036: not too noisy / a bit of trials left, high freq noise
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated

DMSS037: clean / a lot of eye components / a lot of trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated

DMSS038: noisy but nothing we can do on our end / didn't reject an odd wave pattern component (24), as it didn't make the data noticeably better / enough trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated, high frequency noise though sufficient trials left


DMSS039: pretty clean / some odd artifacts at F7 but no representative components / enough trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated


DMSS40: clean / removed first three components (1 and 3 were catching a lot of noise) / a ton of trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated, one IC component captured blinks and stimuli onset, visible wavy pattern even after preprocessing


DMSS041: way too noisy, but nothing we can do on our end at postICA / enough trials left
2022-11-19-wen: postICA rechecked, clean set generated, high freq noise might driven by unstable ground or ref channel during recording.


DMSS046: noisy, with some more trials that need to be rejected, but there is not enough trials left / may need to discard this sn
